# Gemini 3 Integration Summary

Health Harmony is an AI-powered wellness app that leverages five distinct capabilities of Google's Gemini 3 API across every core feature.

**Multimodal Meal Analysis** — Users photograph meals and Gemini 3's vision model identifies ingredients, estimates calories and macronutrients, scores nutritional quality, and suggests healthier alternatives, all from a single image.

**Video Workout Coaching** — Short exercise clips are processed by Gemini 3's video understanding to detect exercises, count reps, evaluate form on a 1-10 scale, flag injury risks, and provide specific corrections.

**Mood Sentiment Analysis** — Journal entries and voice memos are analyzed using Gemini 3's natural language understanding to detect emotions, categorize mood and energy levels, and generate personalized wellness tips and affirmations.

**Streaming Chat Coach** — A real-time conversational coach uses Gemini 3's streaming text generation with full context from the user's meals, workouts, and moods, delivering personalized advice that references actual logged data.

**Cross-Feature AI Insights** — Gemini 3 analyzes 14 days of combined data across all three tracking domains to identify patterns and correlations (e.g., "your mood scores are higher on days you exercise"), surfacing actionable insights users would miss on their own.

All features are accessible in demo mode without authentication, making the full Gemini 3 integration immediately explorable.
